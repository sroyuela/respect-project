  <h2>Integrating high-performance and dependability to develop complex automotive and space systems</h2>
  <h3>Sara Royuela, October 19, 2022</h3>
  <p>Yesterday we were notified that the RESPECT project proposal has been accepted in the <a href="https://agaur.gencat.cat/ca/beques-i-ajuts/convocatories-per-temes/02-Ajuts-dIndustria-del-Coneixement-per-a-lany-2020.-Modalitat-B.-Ajuts-Producte"><i>Ind&uacute;stria del Coneixement 2021 - Modalitat B - Ajuts Producte</i></a>. We thank the <i>Departament de Recerca i Universitats of the Generalitat de Catalunya</i> for this opportunity, and really value the grades obtained in the selection process (6.83/7).</p>
  <p>The project will be lead and developed by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), with the mentoring of two top companies from the automotive and the space sectors, which are Robert Bosch GmbH (BOSCH) and Airbus Defence and Space (ADS). The RESPECT team is formed by 6 members:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sara Royuela (BSC), the responsible scientist.</li>
    <li>Chenle Yu (BSC), the entrepreneur scientist.</li>
    <li>Eduardo Qui√±ones (BSC), the technical expert.</li>
    <li>Adrian Munera (BSC), the research engineer.</li>
    <li>Dirk Ziegenbein (BOSCH), the mentor from the automotive domain.</li>
    <li>Franck Wartel (ADS), the mentor from the space domain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The RESPECT project will bring DePE, our technology for high-performance critical systems, from TRL 4 to TRL 5/6. The technology has been growing since 2016, with the funding of previous projects, like <a href="https://ampere-euproject.eu">AMPERE</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5639503/files/05.01_OBDP2021_Certain.pdf">HP4S</a>. With RESPECT, DePE will be further enhanced with resilience and productivity features to efficiently and safely exploit parallel and heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, DePE will be tested in relevant scenarios of the automotive and the space domains.</p>
  <p>The project starts tomorrow! Keep tuned, we will be adding content soon!</p>
